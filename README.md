# BikeMarketAnalysis

As part of the New Methods in Data Analytics course I am completing within my Bachelor's Degree, I was tasked with analysing the Rotterdam bike rental market in order to produce a service that in theory would attract the largest audience
This progress was done through inputing data into the program JMP and conducting attribute analysis. 
Attribute analysis was completed through conducting effect marginal analysis to find which attributes consumers found to be important.
Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests were completed to find which attributes were statistically significant and to which consumers.
A utility profiler was produced through the analytical results that showed which mix of attributes would provide consumers with the highest utility. The profiler was able to be changed based on the attributes of the consumer. 
Desk research of the Dutch bike rental market was used to find what attributes the consumers that were the most likely to rent a bike possessed, and their attributes were inserted into the utility profiler in order to find what kind of bike would give them the most utility.
Market simulation was conducted afterwards to estimate what % of the bike rental market the bike produced would theoretically gain in the Rotterdam market.
The data was collected through a questionare produced on Qualtrics and distributed online. 
A report was written with the interpretation of the results and the steps taken to reach them.
